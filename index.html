        <h1>Living in Europe</h1>
        <p>
          Europe is a thriving continent which houses many of the world's most socioeconomically developed countries. 
          As a result, many countries have a relatively high GDP Per Capita and Life Expectancy at birth, similar to Australia. 
          The visualisation below explores the cost, quality and viability of living in Europe for a Melburnian, drawing parallels between countries and regions.

          Cost of Living Index: This index is relative indicator of consumer goods prices, including groceries, restaurants, transportation and utilities.<br><br>
          Quality of Life Index: This index is an estimation of overall quality of life by using a formula which takes into account purchasing power, 
          pollution, house price to income ratio, cost of living, safety, health care, traffic commute times and climate.<br><br>
          These indices are relative to Melbourne which has a base index of 100. If another city has, for example, cost of living index of 120, it means that on an average, 
          in that particular city, cost of living is 20% more expensive than Melbourne.<br><br> 
          Cost of Living in Europe is generally quite high across the board, as most countries have a very high quality of life.
          We can see a gradual decrease in living costs and quality of life from the Western and Northern regions of Europe to the Eastern and Southern regions, 
          where countries belonging to the former Soviet bloc are located. 
          The country with the highest cost of living is Swizterland and the country with the lowest is Kosovo.

          We can observe from this chart that capital cities in Western and Northern Europe have on average much higher living costs than Southern and Central and Eastern Europe.
          However, most of the cities from Western and Northern Europe have costs that are comparable to Melbourne and Sydney, which have costs pegged at the high 400 to low 500 mark.

            High GDP Per Capita and Life Expectancy across the board
          </h2>
          <p>
            Here, we can see the GDP Per Capita and Life Expectancy of capital cities in each European region. As expected, Western and Northern Europe lead the
            charge, followed closely by Southern and then Central/Eastern Europe.
            Over the decade however, countries across Europe, especially in Central and Eastern Europe, have had vast improvements in their quality of life and 
            socioeconmic status due to the establishment of the European Union, which promoted economic and social solidarity aross the continent.<br><br>
            Australia, in comparison, has a GDP Per Capita of USD 51,800 and life expectancy of 83 years.

            The wordcloud on the left showcases the most popular sports in Europe by font size - the bigger the more popular.
            Football is by far the most dominant sport in Europe, followed by basketball, tennis and hockey.
            Compared to Australia, there are some overlapping interests as the most dominant sports here are AFL, Swimming,
            Cricket, Tennis, Basketball and Soccer (Football) respectively.

          <p>
            We can see in the pie chart that Europe overall is a fairly homogenous region with most people belonging to the white ethnic group.
            Western and Central/Eastern Europe are the most diverse regions, with around 10-15% of their population belonging to other ethnic groups.<br><br>
            In comparison, Australia has a 76% white population, with 24% belonging to other ethnic groups.

          <p>
            Inspecting the lollipop chart, we can observe that Madrid, London, Moscow and Copenhagen have had a substantial surge in population over the last couple
            of decades. This is largely due to improvements in infrastructure, urban spawl and international migration.<br><br>
            By the same token, Melbourne has also grown at a similar rate due to strong international migration and rising birth rates.
